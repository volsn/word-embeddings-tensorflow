WASHINGTON — Republican Sen. Rand Paul surprised even Republicans on Tuesday by calling for Congress to subpoena the Trump whistleblower over unsupported allegations that the individual was involved in corrupt Ukrainian business dealings.

Asked if he had evidence for any of these suppositions, Paul said, “We don’t know unless we ask.” There is no known evidence that the whistleblower
