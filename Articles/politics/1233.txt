KYIV, Ukraine — A straight-shooting, no-nonsense career US diplomat who was hesitant to return to Ukraine for the Trump administration now appears to have been a voice of reason as two fellow diplomats discussed pressuring Ukraine’s new president to dig up dirt that might help President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign. William Taylor, the chargé d’affaires leading the US embassy in Kyiv since Trump recalled the ambassador, makes clear in stunning text messages with Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, and Kurt Volker, the then–special envoy on Ukraine, that he would rather quit than see Ukraine get muscled into a “nightmare scenario.” Those close to Taylor, who has held several foreign posts in a long diplomatic career, including US ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009, weren’t surprised by his comments. They say he’s a tell-it-like-it-is extrovert who puts matters of state before politics. “He’s a straight shooter,” John Herbst, who served as George Bush’s ambassador to Ukraine from 2003 to 2006 and is a longtime friend of Taylor’s, told BuzzFeed News. “It appears from the texts that he cut through all the nonsense, recognizing that it’s in America’s best interest to see a strong and independent Ukraine.” The US Embassy in Kyiv declined to comment. Taylor was tapped to lead the embassy in Kyiv as chargé d’affaires after Trump recalled Marie Yovanovitch early, as he and lawyer Rudy Giuliani pursued a conspiracy theory that Ukraine had meddled in the 2016 election and pushed for the incoming Zelensky administration to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, who had sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Current and former US diplomats who asked not to be named told BuzzFeed News that when they learned Taylor was returning for another tour in Ukraine they felt relieved, believing he would return stability to the Kyiv post. One of the diplomats who recalled a conversation with Taylor about his decision to return to Ukraine told BuzzFeed
