 Rihanna is Vogue's November cover star, and in a new interview with the magazine, the singer/designer/businesswoman did not hold back when it came to talking politics. Her most pointed words were aimed at President Trump, who she called "the most mentally ill human being in America right now" when asked about the August mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton. "People are being murdered by war weapons that they legally purchase. This is just not normal. That should never, ever be normal. And the fact that it's classified as something different because of the color of their skin? It's a slap in the face. It's completely racist," she said. She also lambasted the president for addressing gun violence as a mental health issue: Of course, this isn't her first time speaking out on the issue. On the day of the Dayton shooting, Rihanna posted a screenshot of the president's response, captioning it, "Um... Donald, you spelt 'terrorism' wrong!" In the same interview, Rihanna also confirmed reports that she had turned down performing at the Super Bowl halftime show in support of Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who began protesting police brutality by kneeling during the national anthem in 2016. Her response: "Absolutely." "I couldn't dare do that. For what? Who gains from that? Not my people. I just couldn’t be a sellout. I couldn’t be an enabler. There's things within that organization that I do not agree with at all, and I was not about to go and be of service to them in any way."
