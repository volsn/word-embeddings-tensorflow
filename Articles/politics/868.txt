A federal judge blocked the most restrictive abortion law in the country Tuesday, a piece of legislation that is almost a complete ban on any abortion procedure in Alabama. The law — which was signed in May and met with nationwide protests — was slated to go into effect Nov. 15, but US District Court Judge Myron Thompson in Alabama issued a preliminary injunction Tuesday morning, blocking it from taking effect “until the court resolves the case in full,” he wrote. On top of banning abortion nearly entirely — it allows the procedure only when the woman’s life is at risk and with no exceptions for pregnancy in the case of rape or incest — the law called for any doctors who performed the procedure to be sentenced to anywhere from 10 years to life in prison. In his decision, Thompson said that while prior Supreme Court decisions on abortion allow for certain regulation of the procedure, the Constitution clearly “forbids the prohibition of abortion prior to fetal viability.” He added that the prevention of bans on abortion before a fetus could live outside the womb is a “bright-line rule,” and that the clinics, patients, physicians, and organizations challenging Alabama’s law are likely to win the case. “The plaintiffs are likely to succeed in showing that the [law] violates an individual’s constitutional right to obtain a pre-viability abortion, and thus that it violates her constitutional rights,” Thompson wrote, “and the defendant agrees.” The defendant, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, has acknowledged that legal precedent on abortion goes against the law he is defending. But the law was not introduced, passed, and signed with the expectation it would actually go into effect. Around the time that the Alabama law was passed, several other states with Republican-majority legislatures passed similarly restrictive abortion laws (though Alabama’s was by far the most strict): Mississippi, Ohio, Louisiana, and Georgia passed bans on abortion after about 6 weeks, bef
