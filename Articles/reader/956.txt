Earlier this year, BuzzFeed Book Club partnered with the New York City Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment to launch this year’s “One Book, One New York” program — the citywide book club getting everyone to read the same book at the same time. New Yorkers voted among five amazing books, and now we’re excited to announce the winner: Just Kids by Patti Smith! Find out about free reading events around the city this summer, and sign up for the BuzzFeed Book Club — where we’ll be opening up the discussion to readers around the world in July.
