P.S. her birthday's coming up on June 4! With the new documentary Ask Dr. Ruth making its Hulu debut today, we had Dr. Ruth Westheimer herself drop by for a fun conversation about sex and dating! The 90-year-old sex therapist answered questions from the BuzzFeed staff about topics ranging from chronic masturbation to open-relationships. I even had the pleasure of asking her a question myself. Women typically talk about using vibrators on themselves, but what if you wanted to use one on a male partner? And let's just say, Dr. Ruth kept things cute and candid. Unless you're giving him a back massage, Dr. Ruth strongly advises AGAINST putting that vibrator anywhere else on his body. And even tough I had the perfect spot in mind, Dr. Ruth shut that idea down real quick. BUT that doesn't mean you can't use the vibrator in the bedroom with your partner...just don't use it ON him. Thanks for all the advice, Dr. Ruth! Want more? Watch our full sex and dating advice video with Dr. Ruth below. Still can't get enough of Dr. Ruth?
