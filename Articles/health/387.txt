You probably recognize him from stuff like Teen Wolf, American Horror Story, and Arrow. Fans also shared comments, calling him "truly inspirational" for sharing his vulnerabilities. You know Colton Haynes. Last week, in an incredibly honest post, the actor opened up about his struggles with addiction, depression, social media, and more. He wrote, "Throwback. I don’t want worrying about if I look hot or not on Instagram to be my legacy. I don’t want to skirt around the truth to please other people or to gain economic success. I have far more important things to say than what magazine I just shot for or what TV show I’m a part of (although I’m very thankful I still get to do what I love)." "I no longer want to project a curated life. I get immense joy when someone comes up to me & says that my willingness to open up about depression, anxiety, alcoholism, & addiction has helped them in some way." "I’ve struggled the past year with trying to find my voice and where I fit in & that has been the most beautiful struggle I’ve ever had to go through." "Worrying about what time to post on social media so I can maximize my likes or being mad at myself that I don’t look the same way I did when I was addicted to pills is a complete waste of why I was put on this earth." "I’m posting these photos to let y’all in on my truth. I’m so grateful to be where I am now (a year after these photos were taken) but, man, these times were dark." "I’m a human being with flaws just like you. If you're in the middle of the dark times...I promise you it doesn’t have to last forever. Love y’all ❤️." Dozens of celebs — including Serena Williams, Justin Baldoni, Lisa Rinna, and more — praised Colton for his candor. It's so refreshing to see celebs use their platform to shine light on tough issues and be honest on social media. Thanks for opening up, Colton ❤️.
