I always found it kind of weird when headlines would market celebrities as "brave" for not wearing makeup or for being proud of their natural bodies. In my opinion, it's condescending. Using the word "brave" in that sense insinuates that it takes courage to do it or that it's out of the ordinary, and that should not be the case. Well, apparently I'm not the only one who feels this way. In a recent interview with Glamour, Lizzo opened up about her distaste for the word. "I don’t like it when people think it’s hard for me to see myself as beautiful. I don’t like it when people are shocked that I’m doing it." "When people look at my body and be like, ‘Oh my God, she’s so brave,’ it’s like, ‘No I’m not. I’m just fine. I’m just me. I’m just sexy.’" And sex appeal is one department Lizzo definitely isn't lacking in! From her high-energy performance at the 2019 VMAs to her amazing sense of style, LIZZO IS 100% THAT BITCH! It only takes 10 seconds to look at Lizzo's Instagram to see she's her biggest fan, so why don't other celebrities get celebrated for their "body positivity" like she does? "If you saw Anne Hathaway in a bikini on a billboard, you wouldn't call her brave. I just think there's a double standard when it comes to women.” Lizzo believes modeling agencies played a role in the narrative shaped around beauty, but feels the internet and social media have done an amazing job of changing that. "If you want to see somebody who's beautiful who looks like you, go on the Internet and just type something in. Type in 'thick thighs' or 'back fat.' You'll find yourself reflected. That's what I did to help find the beauty in myself." "Let's just make space for these women. Make space for me. Make space for this generation of artists who are really fearless in self-love."
