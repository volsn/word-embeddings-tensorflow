Giving birth is a beautiful thing...and sometimes it doesn't happen vaginally, people! People who've had C-sections gave birth, too. So this post is for them! We want to celebrate all the C-section mamas and their beautiful postpartum bodies... ...because recovery can be hard. And painful. Especially when your body is trying to heal while taking care of and carrying kiddos all around. Some C-sections are even performed vertically. So, share your beautiful, post-baby C-section bellies with us. It's time to honor your strength and what your body can do! Submit your photos via the dropbox below and you could be featured in an upcoming BuzzFeed Community post!
