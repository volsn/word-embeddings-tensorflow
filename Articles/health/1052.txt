Happy April Fools' Day, when things like serving "brown E's" are funny... ...and things like tricking people into thinking you brought donuts are comical. But, you know what's not funny? Fake pregnancy jokes. Because 6 million women — in the United States alone — struggle with infertility. SIX MILLION. So, it is very likely someone you know has struggled or is struggling to get pregnant. They might be open about it or struggling quietly with it. So, listen to "Cute-rus." She knows best.
