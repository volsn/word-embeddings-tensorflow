 "I wake up happy, just because I can spend one more day here. Not asking for more or trying to run faster." Over the past decade, Miroslava Duma has been a street style staple. But, the influencer, who has a following of 1.6 million and counting, is recalibrating her career in the wake of being diagnosed with a rare lung disease. Miroslava shared her diagnosis, revealing that she was initially given 7 months to live, in a recent post on Instagram. "Earlier this year I was diagnosed with a rare lung disease, and given 7 months to live," she wrote. "It was crazy scary then, but looking back, I realize that the past few months of recovery were possibly the happiest months of my entire life." Afterwards, Miroslava "stopped running the marathon." "I realized how much I love life, how beautiful our world is and how much I want to stay here," she added, "with the people I love." Her whole perspective shifted: "For the first time in my life, I saw the bright blue of the skies," she shared. "And the beautiful green of the trees. As if I had lived on a different planet before." Miroslava also wrote about how social media has become a much smaller part of her life since. "I now realize that these past months were also the most creative months of my entire 34 years," she added. "Yet success to me today is not measured by external indicators anymore, but by what’s inside. It is measured by my own health, and the health of those I love. It is measured by how I choose to contribute to the world." "Today I continue to follow my big dream, and genuinely believe it can help save our planet," she finished. "No matter what. And against all odds. One day I hope I’ll be able to tell you all about it."
