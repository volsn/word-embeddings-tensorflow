In the next few months, Portland isn't going to know what hit them. 'Cause nine nurses in the same labor unit are all pregnant and due around the same time. Nurse Amanda Spear told CNN affiliate WMTW, "It is really nice coming to work and just talking about these experiences that we are going through together." The hospital also assured people that they are prepared for when all nine nurses go on maternity leave. So, let's just say Maine Medical Center probably throws some pretty awesome parties. ðŸ˜‰ Congrats to all the mommas-to-be!
