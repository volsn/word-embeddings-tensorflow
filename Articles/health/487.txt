Moms love a good deal. A good scam if you will. Maybe you're a mom who has multiple email accounts to get "free trials" or "free shipping." Or maybe you're a kid who has a mom that goes to extreme lengths with her money-saving scams. Perhaps your friend's mom has a scam that she thinks is just brilliant. (Like scamming to get everything free on her birthday.) A mom could even have some sort of scam where she lies to the manager to get what she wants. So, tell us all about the mom scams you know of – the good, the bad, and the ugly – and you could be featured in an upcoming BuzzFeed Community post!
