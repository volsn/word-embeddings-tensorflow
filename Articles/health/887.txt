  In an interview with Dr Phil, Sophie said Maisie was the only person who understood what she was going through at the time. "I think being friends with each other was quite destructive because we were going through the same thing," Sophie said. "We would get home from set, go to a little supermarket across the road and just buy food. We'd go back to our room and eat it in bed. We never socialised for a couple of years." We all know by now that Game of Thrones is about to come to an end, which means a lot of its cast members have been doing some reflecting on how the show changed their lives. In a new interview on Fearne Cotton's Happy Place podcast, Maisie Williams — AKA Arya Stark — opened up about the negative effects fame has had on her mental health since she was cast in the show at13. She said she had experienced a period of time where she was "very sad", admitting she would "crave" negative criticism online so she could "sit in a hole of sadness". Maisie even went so far as to admit there are times when she just wants a "normal life", saying the "crazy, crazy world" of showbiz is "not worth it". Just last month, Maisie's close friend and costar Sophie Turner opened up about her own experience with depression, saying she was seriously affected by negative comments about her appearance on Game of Thrones. Now Maisie says she's been taking time to reflect on her feelings in order to figure out why she's so hard on herself. And she continued to say she's realised the "first step" to happiness is to be genuinely herself, rather than whoever other people want her to be "in the moment".
