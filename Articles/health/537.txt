We've all likely fallen for some sort of scam before. But, only a select few have been REALLY, REALLY badly scammed! Like the kind of scam where you wired all your savings to a criminal. Or maybe one where you got completely catfished on a dating site and it ended badly. Perhaps you entered ALL YOUR PERSONAL information to a website you thought was legit and someone stole your identity. So, are you one of those select few who got REALLY scammed? If so, tell us what unfortunate scam you fell for and you could be featured in an upcoming BuzzFeed Community post!
