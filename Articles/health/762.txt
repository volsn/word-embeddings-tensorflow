That's it! Bye. Enjoy six to seven Boston cream donuts: Present a tray of tots to the Rat King: Enjoy a solitary pear: Get a little barefoot reading in: Take a quick lil' nap: Rest your burger upon the hallowed ground: Play catch: Prepare your world-famous banana and bun sandwich: Rest your headphones in the thin layer of piss on the ground: Leave your retainer out for curious folks: Drop your fried egg: Crunch into a big ol' bag of chips while takin' a shit: Go trick-or-treating: Time travel to the 33rd century: Forget your spaghetti: Hold a service for your almighty lord and savior: Eat an entire package of raw fish: Forget your bowl of four fries: And be named Tyler and absolutely rip into some turkey broth:
