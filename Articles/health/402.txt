What's up world, Crystal and Lara here, and we are aware that people watch porn. We ourselves have watched it a time or two (or a hundred) and while it can often be enjoyable, it can also sometimes...not be. A large part of this is because the depiction of sex or women having sex in a lot of mainstream porn is often unrealistic and just downright offensive. So we compiled a list of the the ways in which porn is unrealistic. We're sure we've missed some so feel free to let us know in the comments! We are *constantly* moaning. Nothing feels that good. And not only are we constantly moaning, but we're moaning super loudly. We never need lube! We're always wet!!! And once we're wet, we're obviously able to stay wet for like 29 minutes straight!

Stick it right in, baby! And don't worry, we can totally come over and be ready to get down to business whenever, wherever. Forget work! Forget responsibilities! We're on our way. Our knees never get chafed from th
