More than 700,000 Australian women have endometriosis, in which cells similar to those that line the uterus grow outside of the uterus, leading to all sorts of symptoms including debilitating pain. Up to a quarter of women with endometriosis are asymptomatic, but most experience dysmenorrhea (painful periods), chronic pelvic pain and painful sexual intercourse, and between 30% and 50% of endometriosis patients struggle with infertility. Endometriosis and infertility “go hand in hand” says Melbourne-based advanced laparoscopic and gynaecology surgeon Dr Kenneth Leong. “On the most basic level endometriosis could cause scarring of the fallopian tubes, which interrupts fertilisation because the egg doesn’t get picked up every month and travel to where it can be fertilised,” Leong, who sub-specialises in infertility and IVF, told BuzzFeed News. The time it takes a woman with endometriosis to be properly diagnosed in Australia can be “up to nine years”, Leong said. “I get a lot of patients where, because endometriosis is so under-diagnosed, they come to see me and many years have passed so they have all this inflammation, tissue destruction, distortion of pelvic anatomy and all of this contributes to infertility,” he said. “In really severe cases where you have this inflammation and your pelvic cavity is just really angry with the disease, the egg quality can actually get affected and there are studies that show it can affect the quality of your endometrial lining, which affects egg plantation,” he said. Leong said the “gold standard” for diagnosing endometriosis remains a laparoscopy — a keyhole surgery used to examine or operate on the interior of the abdominal or pelvic cavities. “During a laparoscopy, you can sight the lesions, you remove them completely and get some tissue to confirm it is endometriosis,” he said. “If it is in the early stages, it is quite easy to treat and you just excise it completely when it hasn’t done enough damage to wreck your fallopian tubes
