Earlier today, Taylor Swift stopped by The Ellen Show for a rare sit-down interview. And during that interview, Ellen DeGeneres asked Taylor a fairly simple question: Do you wash your legs in the shower? Her response had me looking a little bit like this. And Ellen seemed to agree with her leg-washing routine. But I, a woman who does a FULL-body wash from head to toe every day with a bar of soap, was still confused. Sounding a little unsure about her response, Taylor then asked Ellen, "So, that counts?" The "Me" singer didn't quite agree with Ellen's assumption. Whereas Ellen was just trying to piece together the information Taylor was giving her. Taylor reassures Ellen..."kind of"...that she shaves her leg every day... Ellen was shocked and didn't seem fully convinced, but decided to end the convo with a little humor. Ellen then decided to take a poll on Twitter, which showed the majority of her followers DO wash their legs. But that 25% led to a huge hygiene debate on Twitter. Some were in the same boat as me, wondering how you can shower and skip your legs: While others were confused when shaving cream and soap became interchangeable: Hmmm...well, you already know where I stand on the "leg washing debate," but now I want to hear from you. And now that you're done with that, you can check out Taylor Swift's full interview on The Ellen Show below.
