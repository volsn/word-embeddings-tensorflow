As a human being with a uterus/vagina/etc., seeing a doctor can be intimidating, scary, or sometimes downright difficult. And when it comes to birth control, there are a million and one reasons why you'd feel uncomfortable asking someone about it. And that's OK! Like, maybe you don't want to talk to your parents about anything remotely sex-related? Or maybe your current birth control is giving you problems and you want to know what's up? You may have also spent hours spiraling down a Google rabbit hole getting conflicting answers about how birth control even works?!?! Do you have a question that you've been too shy to ask? This is a safe space! Leave your question below, and it could potentially be answered by a doctor in an upcoming BuzzFeed Community post!
