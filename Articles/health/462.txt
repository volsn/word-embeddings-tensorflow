Although kidneys are normally located in the back, on each side of the lower spine, a transplanted kidney gets placed in the front, lower abdomen. Over the last six years Sarah Hyland â€” known for playing the lovely Haley Dunphy from Modern Family â€” has openly talked about her health issues, including receiving two kidney transplants. And by sharing her struggles, she has inspired others to regain confidence in themselves. Earlier this year â€“ at the Vanity Fair Oscars after-party â€“ Sarah defended her reason for wearing two pairs of Spanx. But she has now kicked those Spanx to the curb! In her caption, Sarah talked being both terrified and excited during her first nationally televised performance. Then, after thanking the fans and Fox network, she thanked her lil' kidney bump: Sarah and Jordan McGraw sang "Met at a Party" and SHE AND HER "KUPA" looked ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥! (Jordan looked great, too.) Women appreciated Sarah being her authentic self. Dear Sarah and "KUPA," we love you!
