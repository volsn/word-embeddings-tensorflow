Former Disney Channel star David Henrie and his wife, Maria Cahill, welcomed a beautiful baby girl into the world on Tuesday, March 19. Pia Philomena Francesca Henrie was born in Los Angeles, weighing in at seven pounds and six ounces. She is their first child together. While basking in the joys of newfound fatherhood, David reflected on the difficult journey he and his wife shared in order to bring Pia to full term. "Pia Philomena Francesca Henrie has brothers and sisters...," David wrote on Instagram. "Maria and I suffered three miscarriages before finally being able to carry Pia to full term." "It was insanely difficult recovering from miscarriage after miscarriage." "We knew if we were ever going to be able to hold a baby of our own in our arms that we must not let the tragedy affect our marriage, but rather grow closer together!" Sticking to their faith and the power of prayer, the 29-year-old California native revealed they enlisted the help of Pope Francis. "The reason Pia’s middle name is Francesca is because I personally asked pope Francis to pray for Maria and I to have a baby." "He took our hands, held them together, said a special blessing, then looked up and told me not to worry that a baby would be coming — That was pretty much exactly nine months ago. " David went on to share some encouraging words for anyone else struggling out there: "pray, hope, and don't worry." And although it's only been a couple of days, we can already tell David is cherishing every moment of daddy duty.
