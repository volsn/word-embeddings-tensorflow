Obviously, you know Camila Cabello. It's been two years since the "Señorita" singer gave us the summer jam, "Havana," but I'm still listening to it like I heard it for the first time yesterday. But, instead of celebrating her single, Camila marked the anniversary by shutting down body shamers and lifting up her young fans in a powerful Instagram post. She wrote, "I haven't gone on social media AT ALL with the conscious intention of avoiding things that hurt my feelings. But for a second I forgot while trying to find a pic to post about it being Havana's two-year anniversary, and my eyes accidentally ran over a headline of people 'body shaming me.'' "Honestly, first thing I felt was super insecure just IMAGINING what these pictures must look like. 'Oh no! My cellulite!' 'Oh no! I didn't suck in my stomach!' But then I was like...of course there are bad pictures, of course there are bad angles. My body's not made of fucking rock, or all muscle, for that matter." "But the saddest part of young girls growing up in an airbrushed world is [that] they're seeking a perfection that's not real," she added. "I'm writing this for girls like my little sister who are growing up on social media. They're constantly seeing photoshopped, edited pictures and thinking that's reality — everyone's eyes get used to seeing airbrushed bodies and airbrushed skin, and suddenly they think THAT'S the norm?! It isn't. It's fake. AND FAKE IS BECOMING THE NEW REAL." "We have a completely unrealistic view of a woman's body," she continued. "Girls, cellulite is normal. Fat is normal. It's beautiful and natural. I won't buy into the bullshit today!!! Not today, satan. And I hope you don't either ❤️. Love only, Camila." Not today, satan! Though it can be hard to do sometimes, it's important to love the skin you're in. Thanks for the reminder, Camila! ❤️
