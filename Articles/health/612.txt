Dozens of celebs and fans praised the pic. She added, "Fuckin lames wouldn't be able to stop blabbering if I got my ass done either. Bored as all hell, never can win!" Just a few days ago, Chrissy Teigen posted this vacation pic that is straight-up ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥! And here's another photo of Chrissy that's been making the rounds this week where she STILL looks great. But instead of talking about how cute Miles is (smooshy!!!), people have zeroed in on John's face and his ~apparent~ reaction to Chrissy's backside. FWIW, it just looks like the sun is in his eyes and the sunscreen is melting down his face â€” which, we've all been there â€” and it's annoying as hell! Anyways, the Queen of Twitter decided to comment on the pic herself, writing, "Everyone so used to ass shots and photoshopped Instagrams. I've had no ass forever â€” is this new news to some of you?" The person who originally shared the pic tried to explain, "We laughing at dude face, ma. That's what makes the pic funny. Stay blessed." But, Chrissy wasn't buying it. She responded, "His face, looking at my ass, so nah. I see the comments, you know." The OP replied again, saying that if John wasn't in the pic, it wouldn't be funny, but Chrissy wasn't letting him off the hook. She responded again, "Yeah. His grossed out face looking at my ass. You don't need to explain this to me. I get it. I know the meme and I see the 100s of comments under it *about* my body, and his reaction to it. You were clowning on me or his look at me. That's all." You tell 'em, sis! Personally, I think this pic works better out of context anyway... Me, when someone suggests I do work: Me, when someone says they don't like dogs: And finally, me, when someone talks about another person's body:
