They look pretty luxe. For the record, her sisters did get vibrators in their Poosh boxes. Specifically, the Unity Vibe, by Sincerely, Sportsheets. Kylie's must have just slipped the mind of whoever packed it. No doubt Kylie's is now on the way. Christmas — or should we say Kristmas — came early for the Kardashians this year, thanks to Kourtney, who has been spreading holiday cheer to her family and inner circle with gift baskets. If you follow any of the family members or their friends on Instagram, you've likely seen one of Kourtney Kardashian's holiday gift sets from her lifestyle brand Poosh. One person, however, who was not satisfied with the gift basket is Kourtney's youngest sister, Kylie Jenner. When Kylie received her gift basket from Poosh, she was super happy — at first. "Thank you so much Poosh and Kourtney for this box of dreams right now, I cannot wait to go through this, what have we got in here?," she said, while sharing the goods on Instagram Stories. Once she dug through all of the treats inside, though, she noticed one major thing was missing: "Ummmm...did you not send me a vibrator?," Kylie demanded to know. "Um, Kourtney I think you forgot to put a few things in here, so, I'm going to send this back and we're going to try this again," Kylie said. LOL, these two. It's almost like they should have a reality TV show. Oh, wait.
