Yesterday, ELLE Canada unveiled their latest cover featuring none other than Lana Condor, star of To All The Boys I've Loved Before and Deadly Class. In the accompanying interview, Lana spoke about everything from the importance of representation to her passionate endorsement of the fight against climate change. But she also criticised the world's unfair treatment of women, and specifically the fact that women "feel like they need to apologise" for our physical appearances. Lana went on to say that, as a classically trained dancer, she has firsthand experience of the expectations placed on young girls to look a certain way. "You have to eat. You have to stop thinking that a certain body shape is ideal, because it’s not," she continued. "That’s why I literally post about every meal I eat," Lana said, explaining that she has decided to celebrate her relationship with food rather than criticise it.
