Ehlers-Danlos syndromes, also known as EDS, are a group of connective tissue disorders that can cause joint hypermobility that can lead to frequent dislocations, fragile skin that bruises easily, and other symptoms that may affect skin, bones, blood vessels, and even organs and tissues. There are many types of EDS, some of which can have neurological symptoms. Yesterday, Sia revealed that she suffers from Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. In a tweet Friday, the singer-songwriter shared, "Hey, I'm suffering with chronic pain, a neurological disease, ehlers danlos." "And I just wanted to say to those of you suffering from pain, whether physical or emotional, I love you, keep going." "Life is fucking hard. Pain is demoralizing, and you're not alone," she wrote. After the 43-year-old's announcement, many fans began sharing words of love and support. Others were even inspired to open up about their own experiences with EDS or similar diseases, finding comfort in the solidarity. Thanks for being so open and honest, Sia. Hang in there! ❤️
