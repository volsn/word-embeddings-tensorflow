Louisiana faces major flooding from Barry, as the storm moves slowly north. Parts of the state were already flooded from torrential rain Wednesday, and the Mississippi River is still swollen after record flooding earlier this year upstream. “This storm still has a long way to go before it leaves the state,” Gov. John Bel Edwards said late Saturday. “The worst is yet to come.” This map shows threats from flash floods and rivers bursting their banks. The points show stream gauges for which there is enough historical data to forecast the likelihood of flooding over the next several days. This map shows predicted rainfall over the coming week, and the projected track of the eye of the storm. Use this map to track the immediate threat of rainfall over the next 24 hours. From Saturday onward, the National Weather Service is predicting a high risk of flash flooding in and around New Orleans. Heavy rain will also further swell the Mississippi River. The NWS was predicting that at New Orleans, the river level will rise to 2 feet above its designated flood stage Saturday. But later on Friday, it reduced that forecast to at or around the flood stage level. One huge question for New Orleans was whether the city’s system of levees, infamously breached in 2005 by Hurricane Katrina, would withstand rising water from the river and the sea. The threats from surging seas have now mostly subsided. This map shows storm surge and warnings and watches issued by the National Hurricane Center. As always, obey evacuation orders from local officials. See here for more information on the storm.   This post has been updated to reflect forecast information as Tropical Storm Barry came ashore. Further updated to reflect the change to hurricane status, shortly before the storm made landfall. Updated to add a map of threats from flooding and to reflect threats from flooding.
