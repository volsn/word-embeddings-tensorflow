US suicide rates are the highest they've been since World War II, federal health officials said Thursday, with the rise particularly acute among indigenous women.

Studies have shown that people with alcohol addiction have an increased risk of suicide. "Certainly for [Native American and Alaska Native] men and women, alcohol use by the individ
