The FDA on Friday approved a second drug meant to increase a woman's sex drive. Approval of the injectable drug, bremelanotide, sold as Vyleesi by Amag Pharmaceuticals Inc., follows the unsuccessful 2015 launch of the drug Addyi, a controversial "female Viagra" pill intended to spur sexual desire. "There are women who, for no known reason, have reduced sexual desire that causes marked distress, and who can benefit from safe and effective pharmacologic treatment," Hylton Joffe of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement.

The impact of low sexual desire, she added, "goes far beyond the bedroom and can often result in anxiety, loss of vitality, self-esteem issues and relationship stress." Overall, around 20% to 30% of women report low sexual desire in surveys, although only about half of them see that as a problem.

Amag and its backers are hoping that Vyleesi, injected from a pen dispenser about 45 minutes ahead of sex, will get luckier. (The FDA has approved at least five different drugs formulated to improve erections in men.) "Whether a sometimes effective Addyi or an injectable Vyleesi, pharmacotherapy is not usually a complete solu
