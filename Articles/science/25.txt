The Supreme Court of the Netherlands ruled Friday that the government must take urgent action on climate change to protect the fundamental rights of its people. This decision came in a landmark case begun by the Dutch environmental group Urgenda in 2013, the first in the world to test whether citizens could use human rights law to force their governments to slash greenhouse gas emissions. International human rights law obligates the Netherlands to reduce emissions, the court ruled, "because of the risk of a dangerous climate change that can also seriously affect the residents of the Netherlands in their right to life and well-being." "Today, at a moment when people around the world are in need of real hope that governments will act with urgency to address the climate crisis, the Dutch Supreme Court has delivered a groundbreaking decision that confirms that individual governments must do their fair share to reduce greenhouse gas emissions," an Urgenda spokesperson said after the ruling. Rising sea levels are a serious threat to the Netherlands, one-quarter of which is on land that is already below sea level. Urgenda had already won its case in two lower courts, and today’s ruling upholds a 2018 order that the Netherlands must slash emissions by at least 25% compared to 1990 levels by the end of 2020 in order to protect “the life and family life of citizens.” The Supreme Court ruled today that the 2018 Court of Appeal decision is "definitively upheld," and that the state has an obligation to "protect the residents of the Netherlands form the serious risk of climate change." The Netherlands has already been working to reduce emissions, including shutting one of its five coal power plants by the end of 2019, but getting to the 25% target next year could require drastic action. The Dutch government recently estimated it was only on track to reduce emissions by about 20% next year. The need for climate action has only grown more urgent since Urgenda first brought its case
