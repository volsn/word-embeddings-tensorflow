Tumblr — one of the OG blogging sites — just sold. Its owner, Verizon, agreed to let it go to Automattic, which runs WordPress.com, for a price reported to be less than $3 million.  That's way less than the $1.1 billion that Yahoo paid for Tumblr in 2013. So much less so, in fact, you could buy a pretty nice home near Tumblr's offices in New York for that same amount.  We found seven condos that are going for about the same price as Tumblr. This 3-bedroom, 3-bath is a "great investment opportunity," and comes with "a sybaritic recessed rain shower," 10.5 foot ceilings, and direct subway access. All that for just $2.5 million. Or you could buy Tumblr. A condo duplex in the heart of Manhattan for $2.8 million. This 3,428 square foot residence functions as a live-work space and, unlike your next corporate acquisition, has "no board approval required." Designed by the architect Sir David Adjaye, who was named by TIME as one of its 100 most influential people of 2017. The building's amenities include "indoor and outdoor lounges complete with a chef's catering kitchen, club room, golf simulator, a private IMAX theatre, a kids activity center, and a private rooftop observation deck at the top of the building, nearly 800 feet in the air." $2,995,990, which is probably more than Tumblr cost. This 2-bedroom, 3-bath is offered for $2,698,000 and according to the listing features: "VIEWS, VIEWS, VIEWS AND MORE VIEWS." At this 2-bedroom, 2-bath unit, on the market for $2,500,000, pretty much anything goes. (Unlike the SFW rules on Tumblr.) "Unlimited subletting allowed," and "exchanges also possible & welcome." Just two weeks ago, the price of this 3-bedroom, 3-bath was cut $245,000 to $2,750,000. This spacious 3-bedroom condo is on sale for $2,649,000 — just about what it cost to buy Tumblr. But the micro-blogging site doesn't sport views of the Empire State Building the way this corner unit does. 20 Pine St #2801, New York, NY 10005 7 Dutch St #1, New York, NY 10038 130 Willia
