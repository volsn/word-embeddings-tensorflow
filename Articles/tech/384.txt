BBC News reporters have expressed strong dismay after the UK public broadcaster’s in-house commercial team posted sponsored content it produced for Huawei, the controversial Chinese telecommunications giant. Videos and a stand-alone website WhoIsHuawei.com to promote the “real story” of the company have been made by the BBC’s sponsored content team, StoryWorks. The new BBC campaign was announced in July this year in what the company admitted at the time was an effort to rebrand Huawei and "prevent misinformation". This week, Huawei and BBC StoryWorks began posting the content to Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, beginning with a five-minute video introducing the company. The description from Huawei read: “BBC StoryWorks brings you the real story of #Huawei Founder & CEO #RenZhengfei. It’s a 30-year journey marked with many #challenges and culminating in the company’s transformation into a global tech leader.” The same message was shared on Huawei’s YouTube channel, and the company also bought advertising on Twitter to ensure the video found its way into the timelines of Twitter users. The video shows a series of people delivering gushing testimonials about Huawei and the company’s CEO, Ren Zhengfei, backed by what sounds like Hans Zimmer’s score from the 2010 film Inception. It ends with a call to visit WhoIsHuawei.com and the Huawei logo alongside the BBC’s StoryWorks logo against a black background. The WhoIsHuawei.com link redirects to a site at BBC.com, which is geo-blocked to UK IP addresses. UK visitors to the website are instead shown a spinning dandelion and the message: “We're sorry but this site is not accessible from the UK as it is part of our international service and is not funded by the licence fee. BBC StoryWorks is the content-marketing division of BBC Global News Ltd, a commercial company owned by the BBC (and just the BBC).” Behind the geo-block, visitors could read more glowing, uncritical, BBC-branded content about Huawei. “What brave new paths wi
