Two years ago, Australian YouTuber Fynnpire quit his day job to make videos full-time. The Brisbane-based creator has more than half a million subscribers on his gaming channel, and he derives income from advertising revenue. That's why he was so annoyed when he saw that YouTube had restricted advertising on one of his videos. The frustration soon turned to confusion when Fynnpire saw that the video had been been flagged for "strong profanity used in a hateful or derogatory way" after a manual check by a human moderator.

Fynnpire also noticed that the number of views dropped dramatically when the video was flagged. Fynnpire didn't know how to change YouTube's decision to demonetise the videos. There was no clear way to dispute the ruli
