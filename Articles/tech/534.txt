Earlier this week, Apple made a surprise announcement: The AirPods Pro, featuring active noise cancellation, enhanced sound quality, and grippy silicone tips designed for a more comfortable fit, would be an upgraded version of the company’s wireless earbuds. For the last 24 hours, I’ve been testing the new buds, which hit stores today. My first impression? The AirPods Pro deliver impressive sound for their size and fine (but not stellar) noise cancellation for their price. There’s a lot to complain about when it comes to the original version of Apple’s AirPods. The battery (five hours per bud) doesn’t last a day on a single charge. They don’t offer noise cancellation. The hard plastic, one-size-fits-all design isn’t great for fit, comfort, or sound. They’re susceptible to being lost, dropped, and swallowed.

The ear sticks are unmatched in how easily they pair with Apple devices, their portability, and consistent, reliable connection (which many other Bluetooth-enabled headphones struggle with). The AirPods have also taken their place in culture as a status symbol and bona fide meme. Their ubiquity — and stark white cyborg design — are impossible to ignore. It’s ~cool~ to own them. But because previous models of the AirPods left a lot to be desired on the sound front, my expectations for the AirPods Pro were very high. Also high: the price.

The new AirPods Pro undoubtedly produce better sound than the old AirPods. I actually felt the bass in the Knife’s “Heartbeats.” I heard the details in Darkside’s “Paper Trails” more clearly. My editor, John Paczkowski, a metalhead, said Yob’s "Our Raw Heart" sounded a little muddy, but the AirPod Pros ha
