There’s also a Facebook support group if you do have trypophobia.  The new iPhones are here! There’s an iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max (the bigger one). The 11 Pro and Pro Max have new cameras with three lenses. But people started noticing something about those three lenses... Something troubling. Trypophobia is the fear of small holes. It makes looking at pictures like this one make you feel gross and weird: So if you feel kind of ~squshiy~ looking at this: Or this: Or maybe THIS: Then you do NOT want to gaze at this bad boy. And definitely do NOT look at this.
